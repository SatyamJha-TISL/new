        <h2> First coding bootcamp</h2>
        <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
            Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
            readable English.
        </p>

        <h2>Coolest city ever</h2>
        <p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
            now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and
            a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
            many web sites still in their infancy. 
            Various versions have evolved over the years,
            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
